  A Full Stack JavaScript application using React and a REST API
</h4>

## Description     
This application uses React to create a client for a school database REST API. This is a full stack application that provides a way for users to interact with a school database containing information about courses. Users can create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. They can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.
